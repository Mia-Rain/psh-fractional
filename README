psh-fractional
-- fractional math in pure sh, successor to psh-float-micro
---
Current Status
-- addition 99% working
---- had some odd issues with decimals
---- had issues with "Illegal number"
------ eg: 18471.81672 + 27540.27237
-- major bug within fractional addition
---- numbers with a decimal starting with a 0
---- won't add correctly do to issues with $(())
---- a carrying system for this is needed
---- this bug is likely present in all other methods
  >> FIXED!
-- subtraction ~90% working
---- had issues due to an edge case before: see last commit
------ Fixed
---- has an issue where $e in rad() somehow becomes malformed
------ eg: 23019.18605 - 1139
------ produces: 11629.18605
------ correct:  21880.18605
---- current method uses a system of removing the decimal from $1 & $2
---- and then subtracting them; (m1-m2)
---- the issue is likely in rad() as $((m1-m2)) is correct before
---- being handed to rad()
-- multiplication 100% working
---- length issues when comparing to bc (produces additional decimals)
------ I am not going to attempt to fix this
------ it's really not an issue
---- Issues with larger numbers
------ Overflow occurs often
------ ./tester modified to prevent
------ Recommend no more than 3 decimals; YMMV
---- 200 tests with 0 issues
---- Verified working!
-- division ~90% working 
---- did produce to many decimals
------ Fixed
---- did rarely places decimals in wrong places
------ Fixed
---- has issue with dividing by numbers <1 (eg 0.5)
------ Overflow issue

Outer Usage
-- it is recommended to use this library with psh-fc
-- if you wish to compare numbers that it produces
-- as decimal numbers are not considered numbers by posix sh
---- ssh://g.posix.gay/psh-fc
---
Tester
-- a tester is present at ./tester; it is ofc not pure sh as it compares with bc
-- additionally using it requires that $RPATH is set to ?/psh-prng/ran
---- Edited to produce numbers of varying length
---- Edited to detect some overflow issues
