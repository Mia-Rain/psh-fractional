psh-fractional
-- fractional math in pure sh, successor to psh-float-micro
---
Current Status
-- addition ~85% working
---- has some odd issues with decimals
---- has issues with "Illegal number"
------ eg: 18471.81672 + 27540.27237
---- will debug at later date
-- subtraction ~90% working
---- had issues due to an edge case before: see last commit
---- has an issue where $e in rad() somehow becomes malformed
------ eg: 23019.18605 - 1139
------ produces: 11629.18605
------ correct:  21880.18605
---- current method uses a system of removing the decimal from $1 & $2
---- and then subtracting them; (m1-m2)
---- the issue is likely in rad() as $((m1-m2)) is correct before
---- being handed to rad()
-- multiplication 100% working
---- length issues when comparing to bc (produces additional decimals)
------ I am not going to attempt to fix this
------ it's really not an issue
-- division ~90% working 
---- may sometimes produce to many decimals
------ this will not be fixed
---- rarely places decimals in wrong places
------ eg: 324.81478 / 21715
------ produces: 1.49580833525212986414
------ correct:  0.01495808335252129864
---- Some odd edge case with $dp is causing this...
---- debugging ongoing

Outer Usage
-- it is recommended to use this library with psh-fc
-- if you wish to compare numbers that it produces
-- as decimal numbers are not considered numbers by posix sh

Tester
-- a tester is present at ./tester; it is ofc not pure sh as it compares with bc
-- additionally using it requires that $RPATH is set to ?/psh-prng/ran
