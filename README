psh-fractional
-- fractional math in pure sh, successor to psh-float-micro
---
Plan
-- The plan here is to devise hackish ways to do fractional math
-- for each of the base operations addition, subtraction, multiplication, & division
---
Dev Status
-- this is on pause for now; I'm really tired
---
Current Status
-- addition 100% working
-- subtraction ~90% working
---- decimal placement working now
---- some numbers produce the wrong results... no idea why
-- multiplication 100% working
-- division ~90% working 
---- may sometimes produce to many decimals
---- rarely places decimals in wrong places
---
Tester
-- a tester is present at ./tester; it is ofc not pure sh as it compares with bc
-- additionally using it requires that $RPATH is set to ?/psh-prng/ran
